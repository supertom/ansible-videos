# Other files needed

Local directory /opt/rgs/conf needs to be in place and writable by your user (at least).  An inifile is dropped here during the first demo.

/usr/local/bin/test-camera-params - put this on the image you create for push-camera-params (so, not installed here, but on the image that is required.)

/home/USERNAME/.ansible.cfg - config settings to suppress warnings

/etc/ansible/hosts - put this host file in place to keep the host warning from appearing

Other: gcp.py placed at lib/ansible/module_utils/gcp.py
